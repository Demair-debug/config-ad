# On-Premises Active Directory Deployed in the Cloud (Azure)

This project documents the deployment of a traditional **on-premises Active Directory environment** hosted within **Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines**.  
The goal is to demonstrate foundational identity, authentication, and domain management concepts using cloud-based infrastructure while preserving classic on-prem AD architecture.

---

## Video Demonstration

*(Coming soon — screenshots and screen recording will be added)*

---

## Environments and Technologies Used

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines / Compute)
- Azure Virtual Network
- Remote Desktop (RDP)
- Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
- DNS
- PowerShell

---

## Operating Systems Used

- Windows Server 2022 (Domain Controller)
- Windows 10 (21H2) (Domain-joined client)

---

## Lab Objective

In this lab, you will:

- Deploy a Windows Server domain controller in Azure
- Install and configure Active Directory Domain Services
- Create and manage users, groups, and organizational units
- Join a Windows 10 client to the domain
- Validate authentication and directory functionality

This project focuses on **core Active Directory concepts**, not Azure AD / Entra ID.

---

## High-Level Deployment Overview

1. Create Azure virtual machines for the domain controller and client
2. Install and configure Active Directory Domain Services
3. Promote the server to a domain controller
4. Join a Windows 10 client to the domain
5. Validate user authentication and directory operations

---

## Deployment and Configuration Steps

---

## 1) Create Azure Virtual Machines

Create two Azure virtual machines.

### Domain Controller (DC)

- OS: Windows Server 2022
- VM Size: Minimum 2 vCPUs
- Name: `DC-01`
- Virtual Network: **Allow Azure to create a new Virtual Network during VM creation**
- Private IP: Static (important)

> When creating the domain controller, Azure will automatically create a new resource group, virtual network (VNet), and subnet if default options are selected.
> Static IP addressing is required to prevent connectivity issues caused by IP reassignment.

### Client Machine

- OS: Windows 10 (21H2)
- Name: `CLIENT-01`
- Virtual Network: **Select the existing Virtual Network created with `DC-01`**

> When creating the client machine, ensure it is placed in the same Virtual Network and subnet as the domain controller.

Both virtual machines must reside on the **same virtual network** to allow proper Active Directory domain communication.

---

## 2) Configure the Domain Controller

### Install Active Directory Domain Services

1. Log into `DC-01` via Remote Desktop
2. Open **Server Manager**
3. Select **Add Roles and Features**
4. Install:
   - **Active Directory Domain Services**
   - **DNS Server** (if prompted)
5. Complete the installation

---

## 3) Promote Server to Domain Controller

1. In **Server Manager**, click the AD DS notification flag
2. Select **Promote this server to a domain controller**
3. Choose **Add a new forest**
4. Set the domain name to `corp.local`
5. Set the Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM) password
6. Complete the wizard and reboot the server

<img width="951" height="700" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87001bcf-3500-494e-aef7-4a0600fb74e6" />
<img width="951" height="698" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89db7d01-b51e-48b2-81f1-efabe6d641f9" />

After reboot, `DC-01` is now a domain controller.

---

## 4) Create Organizational Units, Users, and Groups

1. Open **Active Directory Users and Computers**
2. Create Organizational Units (OUs), for example:
   - `IT`
   - `Employees`
   - `Group Computers`
<img width="954" height="667" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/445093b1-38b5-4153-b127-c965c1875a4b" />

3. Create a small set of test domain users (2–3 total), for example:
   - `jdoe` (standard user)
   - `asmith` (standard user)
   - `itadmin` (IT role)
     
4. Create security groups and assign users
<img width="1200" height="702" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74914dc3-36e5-4704-9b40-73416f8f6e86" />

   - In **Active Directory Users and Computers**, create security groups within the appropriate OUs (for example, within the `IT` or `Employees` OU).
   - Create groups such as:
     - `IT-Admins`
     - `Domain-Users`
   - Assign users to groups based on their role:
     - Add `jdoe` and `asmith` to `Domain-Users`
     - Add `itadmin` to `IT-Admins`
   - Use group membership rather than individual user permissions to model enterprise access control best practices.
> Group-based access simplifies user management and ensures permissions can be adjusted centrally without modifying individual accounts.

This establishes a basic but realistic directory structure.

<img width="940" height="662" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89b89117-d4bd-4242-96f8-a78df13bd130" />

> A small number of users is sufficient to demonstrate directory structure, group membership, and policy application without unnecessary complexity.

Default Active Directory containers are left intact, as they are system-managed and required for proper domain functionality. Custom Organizational Units are used instead to model enterprise directory structure and management practices.

## 5) Configure Client DNS and Join the Domain

### Configure DNS on CLIENT-01

1. Log into `CLIENT-01`
2. Open **Network Adapter Settings**
3. Set the **Preferred DNS Server** to the private IP address of `DC-01`
<img width="737" height="787" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e121265f-9e9e-482e-852b-c4bca31bd059" />

### Join CLIENT-01 to the Domain

1. Open **System Properties**
2. Click **Change settings**
3. Select **Domain**
4. Enter the domain name `corp.local`
5. Authenticate using a domain admin account
6. Reboot when prompted
<img width="1143" height="797" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3087510b-2251-4eb5-9824-dcf837638c96" />

---

## 6) Validate Domain Functionality

After reboot:

1. Log into `CLIENT-01` using a domain user account
2. Confirm:
   - Successful domain authentication
   - Group membership is applied
   - Client appears in Active Directory under **Group Computers**
3. Test name resolution and connectivity to the domain controller

<img width="938" height="658" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71f96355-3b38-4225-98dc-fbd9e4f875b4" />
